# Personal Pokedex

Personal Pokedex is my second website. I used EJS, CSS with Bootstrap and the MVC model, always looking for a responsive view. This site shows all the first generation pokemons and their information.

The deployment was made with Railway. The URL is <a href="https://personal-pokedex-production.up.railway.app/">personal-pokedex-production.up.railway.app</a>.

## Installation

```js
npm install

## Usage
